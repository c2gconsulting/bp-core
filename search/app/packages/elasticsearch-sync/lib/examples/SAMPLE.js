* This does not cover elastic search cluster set-up and assumes the cluster is up and running,

/*
* Let's say we have a database with 3 collections: users, posts and comments.
* And we want to have all the collections indexed in elasticsearch. Watchers can be created as below
* */


/*
* define transform functions for each watcher. Takes 3 parameters:
* watcher, document and callBack.
*
* callBack is to be invoked after document transformation with the new document as the parameter



let transformUser = (watcher, user, callBack) => {
  user.fullName = user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName; // object has been transformed
  callBack(user); // callBack called with transformed object
};

let transformPost = (watcher, post, callBack) => {
  post.savedDate = new Date();
  callBack(post); // callBack called with transformed object
};

let transformComment = (watcher, comment, callBack) => {
  comment.author = 'Mustapha Babatunde Oluwaleke';

};

let watchers = [];

// define watchers
let usersWatcher = {
  collectionName: 'users',
  index: 'person', // elastic search index
  type: 'users', // elastic search type
  transformFunction: transformUser, // can be null if no transformation is needed to be done
  fetchExistingDocuments: true, // this will fetch all existing document in collection and index in elastic search
  priority: 0 // defines order of watcher processing. Watchers with low priorities get processed ahead of those with high priorities
};
let postsWatcher = {
  collectionName: 'posts',
  index: 'post',
  type: 'posts',
  transformFunction: transformPost,
  fetchExistingDocuments: true,
  priority: 0
};
let commentsWatcher = {
  collectionName: 'posts',
  index: 'post',
  type: 'posts',
  transformFunction: transformComment,

* Call the init method of the package as below and you are done. Parameters are as follows.
* 1. MongoDB URL (Has to be a replica set for Oplog to be enabled), (can be null if process.env.SEARCH_MONGO_URL is set)
* 2. Elastic Search URL, (can be null if process.env.SEARCH_ELASTIC_URL is set)
* 3. Function to call after package init (can be null),
* 4. Watchers,
* 5. BatchCount - Number of documents to index for each bulk elastic search indexing (Should be set according to elastic search cluster capability)
*
* Note: All parameters are to be supplied in the specified order.
*
  ESMongoSync.init('MONGO_URL', 'ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL', null, watchers, 500);



/*
* Using process vars
* export SEARCH_MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/sample"
* export SEARCH_ELASTIC_URL="localhost:9200"
*
  ESMongoSync.init(null, null, null, watchers, 500);





* That's all! Now whatever CRUD operation that occur in the MongoDB database collection that are specified in the watchers will be synchronized
 * with the specified elastic search cluster in real time. You don't have to worry about your elastic search documents getting stale over time as all
 * CRUD operations are handled seamlessly.
